## About Me

More then developing technology and advances in autonomous systems, I am really interested in working with teams to have a real positve social impact.

Over the years, since working on interesting projects in my dorm room to working on projects that have contributed to extermely powerful robotic manipulators for industrial autonmation to advancements in autonomous dirving systems - it the challenge and company of people that has always excited me.

My name is Karthik, _Robotic Systems Engineering_ major from **School of Computer Science** at **Carnegie Mellon**. Working with an amazing team, advised by _Prof. Red Whittaker and Prof. John Dolan_, we devleoped a system for planetary exploration rovers to autonomouly rescue one-another in case of specific mission-impairing circumstances. With support from Jet Propulsion Lab, we are the [Moon-Wreckers](https://mrsdprojects.ri.cmu.edu/2017teami/). 
One of the spin-off projects form the JPL project was our system for ranking human drivers and autonomous driving agents using [Behavioral Advantage](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08219) methods in Reinforcement Learning.

Further through the summer'18, I was part of ISEE.ai as a "software development intern" in an "advanced autonomous driving systems" team. In the past I have worked on methods for [large scale mapping using multi-agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.02141).

I have recently *graduated from a National Science Foundation sponsored Summer School in Cognitive Robotics* at **MIT's Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Laboratory** which was lead by _Prof. Brian William_ and his amazing group at [MERS Lab](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mers/).

Prior to joining Carnegie Mellon, I worked in the Engineering and Systems Development department at Systemantics. At Systemantics, with support from HBS Alumni Angles, Accel Partners and Blume ventures, we are proud of our data driven approach to make cost effective, safety-first, easy to use robotic manipualtors for factory floor automation.

As part of my undergraduate thesis, I worked with _Dr. Rajan Vaish (Stanford) and Prof. James Davis (UCSC)_ for developing a [computation model that takes advantage of human ability to reason and processing time of computers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07543). I also spent a summer as a research intern in the [Laboratory of Computational Intelligence](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/cs-research/lci) at UBC in Vancouver, where I was working on collaboratively controlled smart powered wheelchair as part of the Canadian Smart Powered Wheelchiar project.

Now, as a robotic graduate major, that I have fair grounding - I can confidently say that collaborative control is much more challenging than autonomous driving. Sure conceptually they might be similar and apparent indoor constraints in use-case dilutes the scope of the smart powered wheelchair, but as an intelligent autonomous system that serves as an embodiment of a person - the degree of autonomous capabilities need to much more human and also hidden.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

```python
# Markdown comments
#include numpy
#include pandas

print "This is not machine learning!"
```
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1 - This is header 1
## Header 2 - This is Header 2
### Header 3 - This is HeADER 3

- Bulleted
- List
- 1. 
- 2.

1. Numbered
2. List
  - Point 1
  - Point 2
**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text
**Is this bold enough?**

_Italics have an under score on either side of the sentence_

`
int a = 1
int b = 1
a+b = 2
cout << The sum of 1 and 1 is 2. <<\n`
